Hi! My name is Shodai Inose and I am a first year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I am currently based in New York, NY and looking for part-time internship opportunities during the school year or full-time opportunities during the summer.

I graduated from McGill University with a bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2021 and spent a year working in consulting.

If you would like to learn more about my experiences, here is a copy of my [resume](documents/resume.pdf) (updated October 2022). 

Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or take a look at my GitHub profile if you have any questions.
